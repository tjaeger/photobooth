## Installation

Follow these steps to install and set up Photobooth on your Raspberry Pi:

1. **Update your Raspberry Pi:**
    ```sh
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
    ```

2. **Install libgphoto2 & gPhoto2 :**

http://www.gphoto.org and download libgphoto2
Get gphoto2 from https://github.com/gphoto/gphoto2

This installs autoconf, needed for compiling later
```sh
  apt install autoconf
  apt install autopoint
```

```sh
    $ cd libgphoto2-2.5.22
    $ autoreconf -is
    $ sudo ./configure
    $ sudo make
    $ sudo make install
```
Example for Build/Install for gphoto2
```sh
autoreconf --install â€”symlink
  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install
```

3. **Install feh:**
    ```sh
    sudo apt-get --purge remove feh
    sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev libx11-dev libxt-dev libimlib2-dev libxinerama-dev libjpeg-progs libpng-dev libexif-dev libexif12
    mkdir Feh_Build
    
    cd Feh_Build
    wget https://feh.finalrewind.org/feh-2.28.1.tar.bz2
    tar jxvf feh-2.28.1.tar.bz2
    cd feh-2.28.1

    make -j4 curl=0 xinerama=0 verscmp=1
    sudo make install
    sudo ldconfig

    feh --version
    ```

4. **Clone the Photobooth repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:tjaeger/photobooth.git
    cd photobooth
    ```

## Usage
