# Photobooth

Photobooth is a simple script collection designed to build a DSLR-based photobooth running on a Raspberry Pi (RPI). This project allows you to set up a fully functional photobooth with your DSLR camera, capturing high-quality images and displaying them directly on the RPI using `feh`.

## Introduction

Photobooth is aimed at hobbyists and professionals who want to create a DIY photobooth using their DSLR camera and a Raspberry Pi. The scripts provided in this collection will help you capture, display, and manage photos effortlessly.

## Features

- Capture high-quality photos using a DSLR camera
- Store photos directly on the Raspberry Pi
- Display photos using `feh`
- Easy to set up and configure

## Requirements

To get started with Photobooth, you'll need the following hardware and software:

### Hardware

- Raspberry Pi (any model with USB support)
  Currently working with RPI5
- DSLR Camera with USB connectivity and TETHERED SHOOTING Functionality
- USB Cable to connect the DSLR to the RPI
- HDMI Monitor for the RPI
- Keyboard and mouse for initial setup
- SD card with Raspberry Pi OS installed
- Optional external USB SSD Drive for Image Storage)

- tested Setup
-- NIKON D90
-- RF603II yongnuo (Radio remote control - built into Buzzer)
-- 2x YN560 external Flash

### Software

- Raspberry Pi OS (latest version recommended)
- gPhoto2
- feh (for image display)

## Installation

Follow these steps to install and set up Photobooth on your Raspberry Pi:

1. **Update your Raspberry Pi:**
    ```sh
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
    ```

2. **Install libgphoto2 & gPhoto2 :**

http://www.gphoto.org and download libgphoto2
Get gphoto2 from https://github.com/gphoto/gphoto2

This installs autoconf, needed for compiling later
```sh
  apt install autoconf
  apt install autopoint
```

```sh
  $ cd libgphoto2-2.5.22
   $ autoreconf -is
   $ sudo ./configure
   $ sudo make
   $ sudo make install
```
Example for Build/Install for gphoto2
```sh
  autoreconf --install â€”symlink
  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install
```

3. **Install feh:**
```sh
    sudo apt-get --purge remove feh
    sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev libx11-dev libxt-dev libimlib2-dev libxinerama-dev libjpeg-progs libpng-dev libexif-dev libexif12
    mkdir Feh_Build
    
    cd Feh_Build
    wget https://feh.finalrewind.org/feh-2.28.1.tar.bz2
    tar jxvf feh-2.28.1.tar.bz2
    cd feh-2.28.1

    make -j4 curl=0 xinerama=0 verscmp=1
    sudo make install
    sudo ldconfig

    feh --version
```

4. **Clone the Photobooth repository:**
```sh
    git clone git@github.com:tjaeger/photobooth.git
    cd photobooth
```

## Usage

To start the Photobooth application, navigate to the project directory and run the main script:

```sh
./photobooth.sh
```

## Components

### backup_images.sh

This script is using rsync to create a Backup every 3 Minutes to a separate Device. Typically that would be a mounted external Drive (eg SSD).
To run it scheduled it needs to be run from CRON

Add the following line to the crontab file to run the script every 3 Minutes.
Make sure you have the PATH correct from the Example, depending on where your script resides

```sh
nano /etc/crontab
*/3 * * * * /home/user/photobooth/backup_images.sh
```

**Explanation**

- Cron: This utility is used to schedule tasks at specified intervals. The cron job */3 * * * * runs the script every 3 minutes.
- rsync: The --ignore-existing option ensures that only new files are copied from the source directory to the backup directory, skipping files that already exist in the backup directory.
- Log File: The script logs rsync activity to a specified log file for monitoring purposes.
This setup ensures that every 3 minutes, the script checks for new files in the source directory and copies them to the backup directory on your USB drive.
